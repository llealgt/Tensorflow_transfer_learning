Transfer learning convolutional neural network
===================


Transfer learning experiment using [vgg16 pre-trained deep neural network](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg) as feature extractor in Tensorflow.This means using the dataset provided on [tensorflow's official transfer learning tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining) but with a different pre-trained vgg16 convolutional neural network.
